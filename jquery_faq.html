<h2><a href='#' id='details'>10 FAL's (frequently asked locations) about Haunted National Parks</a></h2>
<dl>
    <dt>Name: Badlands Nat'l. Park | Location: S. Dakota</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Badlands National Park in South Dakota has a banshee that shrieks at visitors in the Watch Dog Butte
        area of the park. Little is known about the origins of the female apparition who appears in tattered clothes with wild
        hair. Some suggest she might have been a Native American woman killed by a warring tribe. What is known is that she
        appears to hikers, gesturing towards them and mouthing unintelligible words. Then, after they come closer, she begins
        wailing and flailing her arms before disappearing in plain sight. If that's not spooky enough, she is sometimes joined
        by a skeletal companion who plays beautiful music in the hopes of enticing travelers to follow him to their deaths.</dd>
    <dt>Name: Yosemite Nat'l. Park | Location: California </dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Grouse Lake, located in Yosemite National Park, has a spirit that cries out for help - although you
        shouldn't fall for his act. According to legends, a young Native American boy drowned in the lake sometime in the past
        (the first reports of his ghost are from the 1850s) and now he calls out to people nearby for help. However, those
        heroic few who dive into the lake to try save him are never heard from again. </dd>
    <dt>Name: Mammoth Cave Nat'l. Park | Location: Kentucky</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky has some really cool caves to explore - and a very interesting
        ghost. Back in the 1800s, a slave named Stephen Bishop worked as a cave guide, giving tours to visitors. Unfortunately,
        he died before he could buy his way to freedom. According to legend, he was buried at the mouth of the cave and haunts
        it today. He enjoys popping up during tours, scaring tourists by showing himself to them and then vanishing, and blowing
        out their lanterns, leaving them in the dark. </dd>
    <dt>Name: Cuyahoga Valley Nat'l. Park | Location: Ohio</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">One of the main visitors centers in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park is located on a plot of land
        nicknamed Hell's Half Acre. The building now housing the center once served as a tavern for canal boat captains and
        their employees (as well as prostitutes), where unsavory hijinks ensued. Some of these troublemakers clearly stuck
        around after death, as the scent of pipe smoke wafts across the near-empty parking lot, employees witness strange cold
        spots, and disembodied shouting voices can be heard. The ghosts of a Union soldier and his beloved also walk the towpath
        right outside of the visitor's center, sometimes showing themselves to people before disappearing. </dd>
    <dt>Name: Great Smoky Mountains Nat'l. Park | Location: Tennessee</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Back in the early 1800s, a settler in the area that now makes up the Great Smoky Mountains was killed
        while searching for his daughter after she got lost in the woods. His spirit remains there and appears in the form of a
        mysterious human-sized yellow light. Apparently, he has been known to help other lost people by showing them the way home,
        although he scares more people than he helps by popping up on very dark nights in front of unsuspecting campers. </dd>
    <dt>Name: Yellowstone Nat'l. Park | Location: Wyoming</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Roosevelt Lodge in Yellowstone National Park sits near the grounds of an old inn formerly run by a man
        named John R. Yancey, who started off in the area as a squatter. After his death, he stuck around until his inn was
        destroyed and the Roosevelt Lodge was built - and then he moved in to his new home. He now plays tricks on hotel employees
        and visitors alike, throwing things around in the rooms, waking up hotel staff at 3 AM, yelling and shouting, and, for the
        very unlucky ones, showing himself in their bathroom mirrors. </dd>
    <dt>Name: Grand Canyon Nat'l. Park | Location: Arizona</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">An apparition of a woman in a blue and white flowered dress appears on the trail at Grand Canyon National
        Park right in front hikers. According to stories, she is the ghost of a woman who lost her husband and son while they were
        hiking on the trail in the 1920s. She died shortly after hearing the news of their accident and now haunts that same trail,
        crying out in grief, looking for them. Multiple hikers have seen her and dubbed her the Wailing Woman. </dd>
    <dt>Name: Great Smokey Mountains Nat'l. Park | Location: Tennessee</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Don't leave your children alone in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. An old Cherokee legend tells the
        tale of a witch named Spearfinger who still haunts the shores of Norton Creek. She preys on young children, removing their
        organs and eating their flesh. If you listen closely on a quiet day, you might even hear her calling out in an attempt to
        lure children away from their parents. </dd>
    <dt>Name: Olympic Nat'l. Park | Location: Washington</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Olympic National Park is home to beautiful Lake Crescent, as well as a nearby deep pool of water called
        the Devil's Punchbowl. Both are haunted by the same Lady of the Lake, Hattie Latham Illingworth, a murder victim who was
        found floating on the water, perfectly preserved, several years after she disappeared in 1937. According to news reports,
        her husband beat her to death, weighed her body down with rocks, and dropped her into the lake. The cold temperature
        preserved her body, as well as her spirit, which now shows itself to people boating on and walking around the lake. </dd>
    <dt>Name:Gettysburg Nat'l. Battlefield Park | Location: Tennessee</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">The Devil's Den, an area of rocky outcroppings and caves, saw some bloodshed during the Battle of
        Gettysburg. It's now haunted by spirits that appear in dark corners and show up as orbs in photographs, but the creepiest
        ghost is the one who speaks to people. Known as "The Hippie" or "The Tennessean," he appears barefoot and carrying a rifle,
        pointing in various directions and instructing onlookers that what they're looking for "is over there." Perhaps that's
        where his body is buried?</dd>

            <br>Try to sample destinations within each of the park's major ecosystems: subalpine, coast, temperate rain forest, and lowland forest
            <br>Check the park calendar and newspaper for current information and schedule of programs.</p>
