2. Execute the following statement in the Chrome JavaScript console and then follow the directions below.

var sample = "Hello Codeup";

Use .length to find the number of characters in the string.

sample.length

Try to make the sample string all upper or all lower case.

sample.toUpperCase()
sample.toLowerCase()

Update the variable sample via concatenation so that it contains "Hello Codeup Students".

sample = sample + " " + "Students"

Replace "Students" with "Class".

sample.replace("Students", "Class")

Find the index of "c" using .indexOf(), what do you observe? NO LOWER CASE C, returns -1

sample.indexOf("c")

Find the index of "C" using .indexOf().

sample.indexOf("C")... returns 6

Retrieve a substring that contains only the word "Codeup" by using indexOf() and substring().

sample.substring(sample.indexOf("Codeup"), sample.indexOf("Codeup") + "Codeup".length)


3. Write some JavaScript code, that is, variables and operators, to describe the following scenarios.
Do not worry about the real operations to get the values, the goal of these exercises is
to understand how real world conditions can be represented with code.


// Movie Rental
You have rented some movies for your kids: The little mermaid (for 3 days),
Brother Bear (for 5 days, they love it), and Hercules (1 day, you don't know yet if they're going to like it).
If price for a movie per day is $3, how much will you have to pay?

...

var rentalPerDayDollars;

var littleMermaidDays;
var brotherBearDays;
var herculesDays;

var totalRentalCost;

totalRentalCost =
(parseInt(littleMermaidDays)
+ parseInt(brotherBearDays)
+ parseInt(herculesDays))
* parseInt(rentalPerDayDollars);


// Contractor
Suppose you're working as a contractor for 3 companies: Google, Amazon and Facebook,
they pay you a different rate per hour. Google pays $400, Amazon $380, and Facebook $350.
How much will you receive in payment for this week? You worked 10 hours for Facebook, 6 hours for Google and 4 hours for Amazon.

...


var googleHourlyRateDollars = input;
var amazonHourlyRateDollars;
var facebookHourlyRateDollars;

var googleHours;
var amazonHours;
var facebookHours;

var totalPayment;

totalPayment = googleHours * googleHourlyRateDollars;
totalPayment += amazonHours * amazonHourlyRateDollars;
totalPayment += facebookHours * facebookHourlyRateDollars;


// Student Enrollment
A student can be enrolled to a class only if the class is not full and the class schedule does not conflict with her current schedule.

...

var classIsNotFull; // boolean
var classSchedulesCheck; // boolean

var studentEnrolled = classIsNotFull && classSchedulesCheck;











// Product Offer
A product offer can be applied only if people buys more than 2 items, and the offer has not expired. Premium members do not need to buy a specific amount of products.
Use the following code to follow the instructions below:

...












var numberOfItemsForDiscount;
var numberOfItems; // number
var offerIsNotExpired; // boolean
var isPremiumMember; // boolean

var productDiscountApplied = premiumMember || (numberOfItems >= numberOfItemsForDiscount && offerIsNotExpired);












// Password Validator

var username = 'codeup';
var password = 'notastrongpassword';

Create a variable that holds a boolean value for each of the following conditions:

the password must be at least 5 characters
the password must not include the username
the username must be no more than 20 characters
neither the username or password can start or end with whitespace


var isPassMinLength;
var isUsernameNotInPass;
var isUserNameUnderMaxLength;
var isUserNameTrim;
var isPassTrim;

var isPassMinLength, isUsernameNotInPass, ...;

var isValidPass = isPassMinLength && isUsernameNotInPass && isPassTrim;
var isUsernameValid = isUserNameUnderMaxLength && isUserNameTrim;
